## ⚙️ Configuration

### GitHub API Token
To avoid hitting GitHub's API rate limits, you can provide a personal access token.
Create a token with no special permissions needed and set it in the launcher settings.
You can create a token at ```GitHub Settings -> Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token```
You don't need to give it any special permissions. Then paste that Token into your Settings field. Do not share your Token!

### games.json Structure

The launcher uses a `games.json` file to manage the available games. You can customize this file to add your own games or modify existing entries. The file is organized into three categories: `standard`, `experimental`, and `custom`.

#### Game Entry Properties

Each game entry requires the following properties:

- **`name`** - The display name of the game as it appears in the launcher
- **`repository`** - The GitHub repository in the format `username/repository`
- **`branch`** - The branch to fetch the game icon from (e.g., `main`, `dev`)
- **`imageRes`** - The filename of the icon PNG located in the repository's `/icons` directory (e.g., `512` for `512.png`)
- **`folderName`** - The folder name where the game will be downloaded and installed
- **`customDefaultIconUrl`** *(Optional)* Overwrites the default Icon of each game. If left blank it will use the default recomp /blob/dev/icons/"imageRes".png, or be blank if not found. Leave as `null` if not needed

#### Example Configuration
